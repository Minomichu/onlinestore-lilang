# Online store: Lilang

Building the front of an online store using photos that have been captured and processed by myself. Also using cinematography.  

The assignment was mainly imaging for web including self-made design sketches, but also responsiveness and overall impression of the company the online store represented - this website was built for a company that are trying to sound tougher than they are.

The JavaScript-file for execution of everything related to articles in basket was pre-written and selected parts of it were used where it fitted.
